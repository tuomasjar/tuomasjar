### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a embedded engineer of humble proportions

---
Working with microcontrollers is my passion, but all kinds of coding and software design interests me. 
I've done some work with hydraulic robots. Beep-boop.

I mostly like learning new technologies and new tecnics. Even though my beginnings are in C and it's successors, I do have learned the ways of Java and dabbled in mystics of assembly. 

But I do not fear the new comers either, so do not think of me as set in my ways. I relish the challenge and am humble enough to admit that I do not know everything and can see the benefit of new lore.
