### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a embedded engineer of humble proportions

---
Working with microcontrollers is my passion, but all kinds of coding and software design interests me. 
I've done some work with hydraulic robots. Beep-boop.

I mostly like learning new technologies and new tecnics. Even though my beginnings are in C and it's little brothers, I do have learned the ways of Java and dabbled in mystics of assembly. 
Working on my masters on robotics and automation, so now I have dipped my toes on Python. May the overlords have mercy on my parity check.
