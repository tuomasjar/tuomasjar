### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a embedded engineer of humble proportions

---
Working with microcontrollers is my passion, but all kinds of coding and software design interests me. 
I've done some work with hydraulic robots. Beep-boop.

I mostly like learning new technologies and new tecnics. Even though my beginnings are in C and it's little brothers, I do have learned the ways of Java and dabbled in mystics of assembly. 

Working on my masters on robotics and automation, so now have dabbled in Python as well. May bitoverlords have mercy on my sanity.
